# Data
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, [The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems](http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf), and can also be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
- Id : Unique value representing each record
- SepalLengthCm : Length of the sepal (in cm)
- SepalWidthCm : Width of the sepal (in cm)
- PetalLengthCm : Length of the petal (in cm)
- PetalWidthCm : Width of the petal (in cm)
- Species : Species name

This dataset is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
